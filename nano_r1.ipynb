    "Single GPU · No TRL or Verl · Efficient · 3B Base Model · Full Parameter Tuning Implementation of R1-zero training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by [TinyZero](https://github.com/Jiayi-Pan/TinyZero) and [Mini-R1](https://www.philschmid.de/mini-deepseek-r1), but designed to be **simpler**, **cleaner**, and **faster**, with every line of code visible and understandable."

    "R1-Zero is arguably the more interesting contribution from the DeepSeek R1 paper. The core idea: take a freshly pre-trained LLM (straight out of the unsupervised pretraining oven) and continue its training using reinforcement learning *without* any human feedback or supervision. The result? A model that starts showing emergent behaviors like self-reflection, verification, backtracking that researchers have tried to bake into LLMs using handcrafted tricks and inductive biases, at least since O1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we’ll build an R1-Zero-style training loop **from scratch**. The goal is to create a crystal-clear, hackable foundation for RL-style LLM training; one that gives you a bird’s-eye view of every moving part and how they fit together. Perfect for playing around, extending, or hacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why another R1-Zero implementation?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are already great implementations like [TinyZero](https://github.com/Jiayi-Pan/TinyZero) and [Mini-R1](https://www.philschmid.de/mini-deepseek-r1). But they rely on full-fledged RL libraries (like `trl` or `verl`) to handle training.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries exist for good reason; efficient RL training for LLMs sits at the crossroads of scalable training and fast inference. Making that work takes a lot of engineering. But that also means the internals are often abstracted away, hard to read, and even harder to tweak.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is different: **no abstractions, no hiding**. You’ll see everything, top to bottom. A lightweight, readable codebase that still follows best practices and runs efficiently on a single GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is this notebook, exactly?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll train a base LLM using RL to solve a reasoning-heavy algorithmic task. The setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model**: Qwen2.5 3B-Base  \n",
    "- **Dataset**: Countdown-Tasks-3to4  \n",
    "- **Algorithm**: GRPO (a variant of policy gradient)\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the task is a bit toy-ish—but it captures the essence of R1-Zero: emergent behaviors like self-reflection, verification, backtracking, even language-switching. This setup is ideal for rapid prototyping and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is this notebook for?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Anyone interested in RL training for LLMs  \n",
    "- Researchers, especially the ones in academia, exploring reasoning in language models\n",
    "\n",
    "### What should I know before jumping in?\n",
    "\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The goal is to train a base LLM to **reason** in a way that allows it to **reevaluate** its own outputs and **improve** them, all without human supervision. The DeepSeek R1 paper proposes a surprisingly simple recipe to achieve this, and that's exactly what we'll implement in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Recipe\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the high-level procedure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start** with a base LLM and a dataset containing problem prompts paired only with their *final answers* (no intermediate reasoning steps).  \n",
    "2. For each iteration $i = 0$ to `NUM_ITERATIONS`:\n",
    "   - Sample a batch of prompts $\\{x_i\\}_{i=1}^N$ from the dataset.\n",
    "   - For each prompt, sample $G$ responses from the model:  \n",
    "     $ y_1, y_2, \\cdots, y_G \\sim \\pi_\\theta(y|x) $\n",
    "\n",
    "     These $G$ responses form what is called a *group* in GRPO.\n",
    "   - Compute a reward $R_i$ for each response and normalize them tocalculate the GRPO advantage within each group.\n",
    "   - Create a list of $N \\times G$ episodes, i.e., pairs of $(x_i, y_i)$ along with their corresponding advantages.\n",
    "   - Estimate the policy gradient $\\vec{g}_{pg}$ from these episodes.\n",
    "   - Update the model parameters:  \n",
    "     $\\theta \\leftarrow \\theta + \\eta \\vec{g}_{pg}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Structure Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The code you will see is structured directly following this recipe. It boils down to three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Episode Generation**  \n",
    "   - Generate $ (x, y) $ pairs along with their advantages for each RL iteration.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Reward Calculation**  \n",
    "   - Compute rewards for each generated response.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Policy Gradient Estimation**  \n",
    "   - Use the generated episodes to estimate the policy gradient and perform the model update.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, these three components come together in a simple loop that trains the model, step by step, to develop reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning.\n"

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The goal of episode generation is to create a collection of query-response pairs that will be used for policy training. From the reinforcement learning (RL) perspective, the **query** serves as the initial state, and the generated tokens in the **response** represent the actions taken by the policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `create_training_episodes` function takes a list of prompts (initial states) and their corresponding completions which we generate using the model.  In GRPO, we always generate multiple responses per prompt—specifically, `GENERATIONS_PER_SAMPLE` > 1. This means that, after episode generation, we end up with `batch_size × GENERATIONS_PER_SAMPLE` episodes in every RL iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantage Computation\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to generating episodes, `create_training_episodes` is also responsible for computing the **advantage** for every response token. \n",
    "\n",
    "In RL terms, the advantage of a token represents how much better or worse that token's action is compared to the average generate token at that specific state (prompt + prefix). Ideally, we would compute an advantage for every token individually to capture how each step contributes to the overall reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in GRPO, there's no per-token advantage computation. Instead, we compute a single advantage value per response. This value reflects how good the entire response is relative to other responses generated for the same prompt. We then assign this single advantage value uniformly to all tokens within that response.\n",
    "\n",
    "GRPO uses a simple formula for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For each prompt $x$ with a group of generated responses $y_1, y_2, \\ldots, y_G \\sim \\pi(\\cdot|x)$, compute their rewards $R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G$.\n",
    "2. Compute the group's mean and standard deviation:  \n",
    "   $ \\mu = \\text{mean}(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G) $  \n",
    "   $ \\sigma = \\text{std}(R_1, R_2, \\ldots, R_G) $\n",
    "3. Compute a **relative score** for each response:  \n",
    "   $ R^*_i = \\frac{R_i - \\mu}{\\sigma} $\n",
    "4. Assign this relative score $R^*_i$ as the advantage to all tokens of the $i$-th response:  \n",
    "   $ A_t^{(i)} = R^*_i $\n",
    "\n",
    "This **per-group normalization** encourages responses that are better than average and penalizes those that are worse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Advantage in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a binary reward scenario where each response is either correct (1) or incorrect (0):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std())\n",
    "array([ 1.22474487,  1.22474487, -0.81649658, -0.81649658, -0.81649658])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the correct responses receive higher advantage scores, promoting them in future updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If only one response is correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std())\n",
    "array([ 2. , -0.5, -0.5, -0.5, -0.5])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This resembles the case where the question in the prompt is too hard and the model is not able to generate a correct response on average.\n",
    "However, if one of the responses is correct, it will be assigned a higher advantage score, and all incorrect responses will be assigned a negative relative score.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all responses are incorrect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since there is no one is better than the average, the model receives no learning signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all responses are correct:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 1])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0., 0., 0., 0., 0.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, no learning signal is provided because there is nothing to improve upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more mixed case:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rewards = np.array([1, 1, 1, 1, 0])\n",
    ">>> (rewards - rewards.mean()) / (rewards.std() + 1e-6)\n",
    "array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5, -2.])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents an easier question for the model. Most responses are correct, but occasional incorrect ones are heavily penalized."

    "- $ \\pi_{\\theta_{\\text{old}}} $ is the policy from the previous iteration (the policy we sampled episodes from),\n",
    "- $ A_t $ is the advantage.\n",

    "This objective tries to increase or decrease the probability of tokens based on the advantage $A_t$ only when the ratio between the new and old policy probabilities stays within a small range, controlled by the clipping threshold $\\epsilon$.

    "### Fully Online Setting: Simplifying the Objective\n",
